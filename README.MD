# Welcome to the Warehouse coding exercise.  
  
## General information  
  
The idea of this task is to provide more details about your general coding skills. During the technical interview we would like to discuss your solution.  Please complete the task within 7 days.  
  
## Implementation details  
  
* In the Warehouse folder, you can find the Java Maven project that can be imported into your favorite IDE.  
* It is a basic project that simulates assets warehouse where a user can perform some basic operations via API.  
* Assets can be distinguish with a unique serial number.  
* We have created an acceptance test package for you, com.example.warehouse, which contains WarehouseApiTest class.  
* Currently, all tests are failing. Fix the tests so they successfully pass.  
  
## Important information  
  
* Please do not modify tests in the WarehouseApiTest class.  
* You can move this class to a different package or edit the setUp() method. Important: Do not edit any other tests methods.  
* You can modify any other classes, add new classes, add necessary libraries, etc. It is your decision on how you will solve the task.  
* Pay attention to code quality, tests, good coding practices, etc. Note: Consider your code as ready for production.  
* Do not use an external database for storing assets. Use only native Java.  
  
## Warning

Please don't post this exercise on ony kind of public repository, such as github. It is for internal use only. Dispose of the code once the technical interview is finished.
  
## Final words  
  
We would like to respect your time, so please do not spend too much time on this task (2-4 hour should be sufficient to complete the exercise)
  
Good luck and have fun!
